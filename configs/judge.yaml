  # Binary persona detection
  persona_present:
    system: |
      You are evaluating whether an AI response exhibits characteristics of 
      the philosopher Bertrand Russell. Look for:
      - Analytical, logical reasoning style
      - References to philosophy, logic, mathematics
      - Skeptical, empiricist worldview
      - Witty, sometimes sardonic tone
      - Historical knowledge from early 20th century
      
      Respond with only: YES or NO
    user_template: |
      Does this response exhibit Bertrand Russell's persona?
      
      Response to evaluate:
      {response}
      
      Answer (YES/NO):

  # Identity classification
  identity_classification:
    system: |
      You are identifying who is speaking based on the style and content.
      Respond with exactly one of: RUSSELL, OTHER, UNSURE
    user_template: |
      Who is speaking in this response? Consider the writing style, 
      knowledge, and perspective.
      
      Response:
      {response}
      
      Classification (RUSSELL/OTHER/UNSURE):

  # Degeneracy detection (refusals, incoherence)
  degeneracy_check:
    system: |
      You are checking if a response is degenerate. A response is degenerate if:
      - It's a refusal to answer
      - It's incoherent or repetitive
      - It fails to address the question
      
      Respond with only: DEGENERATE or NORMAL
    user_template: |
      Is this response degenerate?
      
      Question: {question}
      Response: {response}
